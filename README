A method of speeding up your concrete5 site. Note that tinifier is still a beta version, and to use on production sites with care.

Installation instructions-
1) download tinifier
2) move view.php to the root/libraries directory of your site
3) move tiny.php to the root/helpers directory of your site.
4) enjoy!

Debug  Instructions
1) create a new user that I can login in as with a name of say debugj
2) replace line 775 of the view.php file - currently
if(!$cp->canWrite() && !$c->isSystemPage()){
with 
$u = new User();
if($u->getUserName()=="debugj"{
3) email jack.lightbody@gmail.com the login details to the concrete5 backend and ftp

this will ensure that I can take a look at your site, but no one else will be able to see tinifier.
